Autumn is a great season! The fallen leaves have clad our little village in a
golden attire. The harvest gathering is nearly over. The villagers are resting
and walking around the streets, enjoying the rays of the setting sun and the
last warm evening of the approaching fall. Watch the life of the village in 4k
